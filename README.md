<!-- Etch-a-Sketch  -->

This is a browser-based Etch-a-Sketch style app where the user can control the size of the pixels. The user enters any number between 1 and 100 to set how many pixels run along one row of the canvas. Users can then draw by moving their mouse over the pixels.

<!-- How It Works -->

- User selects how many pixels they want
- Pick a color
- Mouseover event listener allows the user to start drawing on the canvas
- Reset or erase

<!-- Why I Made It -->

For fun.  
Itâ€™s a quick HTML/CSS/JS experiment to mess around with the DOM and event listeners.

<!-- Tech Used -->

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
